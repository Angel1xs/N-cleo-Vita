NÚCLEO VITA is an educational video game that combines the strategy of Plague Inc. with the question dynamics of Preguntados, with the aim of promoting environmental awareness in an interactive way. The project was developed as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge, based on data from the Terra satellite, the longest-running daily observer of Earth, which for more than 25 years has recorded key information about environmental changes and processes on the planet.

Based on this data, the game presents a timeline of real environmental events from 1999 to 2025 and then proposes hypothetical future scenarios in which the player must choose between different possible solutions. Each answer has a score that reflects its level of sustainability and environmental awareness.

Beyond entertainment, NÚCLEO VITA seeks to inspire critical thinking and informed action in the face of current climate challenges, integrating science, technology, and education into an accessible and meaningful digital experience.
